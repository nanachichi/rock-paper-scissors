# Rock Paper Scissors
### Cirno's Perfect Rock Paper Scissors
Touhou Project themed (with an RPG-style textbox) Rock Paper Skissors game.  

Live version is [here](https://nanachichi.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/).  
WARNING! There's music that starts playing after you start the game.

This is my first project where I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript together.  

The benefits I got from working on this project:

* Improved my understanding of functions in JavaScript (scopes, invoking, refactoring, splitting up into smaller functions).
* Learned how to use spritesheets and animate them (animation, transform).
* Expanded my knowledge on DOM manipulation through JavaScript (creating, modifying, styling, appending, deleting).
* Improved my CSS and Javascript skills.
* Enjoyed coding.

I tried my best at keeping readable code, making descriptive names and designing nice UI.
